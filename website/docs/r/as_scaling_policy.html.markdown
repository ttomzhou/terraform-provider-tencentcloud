# tencentcloud_as_scaling_policy

Provides a resource for an AS (Auto scaling) policy.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "tencentcloud_as_scaling_policy" "scaling_policy" {
  scaling_group_id    = "asg-n32ymck2"
  policy_name         = "tf-as-scaling-policy"
  adjustment_type     = "EXACT_CAPACITY"
  adjustment_value    = 0
  comparison_operator = "GREATER_THAN"
  metric_name         = "CPU_UTILIZATION"
  threshold           = 80
  period              = 300
  continuous_time     = 10
  statistic           = "AVERAGE"
  cooldown            = 360
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

* `adjustment_type` - (Required) Specifies whether the adjustment is an absolute number or a percentage of the current capacity. Available values include CHANGE_IN_CAPACITY, EXACT_CAPACITY and PERCENT_CHANGE_IN_CAPACITY.
* `adjustment_value` - (Required) Define the number of instances by which to scale.For CHANGE_IN_CAPACITY type or PERCENT_CHANGE_IN_CAPACITY, a positive increment adds to the current capacity and a negative value removes from the current capacity. For EXACT_CAPACITY type, it defines an absolute number of the existing Auto Scaling group size.
* `comparison_operator` - (Required) Comparison operator, of which valid values can be GREATER_THAN, GREATER_THAN_OR_EQUAL_TO, LESS_THAN, LESS_THAN_OR_EQUAL_TO, EQUAL_TO and NOT_EQUAL_TO.
* `continuous_time` - (Required) Retry times (1~10).
* `metric_name` - (Required) Name of an indicator, which can be CPU_UTILIZATION, MEM_UTILIZATION, LAN_TRAFFIC_OUT, LAN_TRAFFIC_IN, WAN_TRAFFIC_OUT and WAN_TRAFFIC_IN.
* `period` - (Required) Time period in second, of which valid values can be 60 and 300.
* `policy_name` - (Required) Name of a policy used to define a reaction when an alarm is triggered.
* `scaling_group_id` - (Required, ForceNew) ID of a scaling group.
* `threshold` - (Required) Alarm threshold.
* `cooldown` - (Optional) Cooldwon time in second. Default is 300.
* `notification_user_group_ids` - (Optional) An ID group of users to be notified when an alarm is triggered.
* `statistic` - (Optional) Statistic types, include AVERAGE, MAXIMUM and MINIMUM. Default is AVERAGE.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to all arguments above, the following attributes are exported:

* `id` - ID of the resource.
